  "body": "### **Abstract**\r\nThis project focus on automatic image colorization given a greyscale input image. Different from [Levin et al.'s](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/%7Eyweiss/Colorization/) approach, and [Image Analogies](http://mrl.nyu.edu/projects/image-analogies/) which rely on user interaction, this project implement a fully automatic colorization method proposed in [Large-scale Learning](http://vision.cs.illinois.edu/projects/lscolor/largescale_automatic_colorization.pdf) which exploits a LEARCH framework to train a quadratic objective function in the chromaticity maps and then colorize the image by minimize this objective function.\r\n\r\n***\r\n### **Best result**\r\n\r\n***\r\n### **Problem definition**\r\nWhat are the specific inputs and outputs of your program.\r\n\r\n***\r\n### **Related Work**\r\nDoes your code replicate an existing paper? What is that paper? If not an exact replica, what are the closest works?\r\n\r\n***\r\n### **Algorithm**\r\nDid you exactly replicate a prior work? Almost? What differences do you have? You may use code that implements the main idea of your project, but then you must have a project that explores modifications to the basic code, a substantially different dataset or for a different purpose than the original authors intended.\r\n\r\n***\r\n### **Analysis** \r\nNow that you have used this approach, what do you think are its main strengths and weaknesses.",
