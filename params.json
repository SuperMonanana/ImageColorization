What is that paper? If not an exact replica, what are the closest works?\r\n\r\n***\r\n### **Algorithm**\r\nDid you exactly replicate a prior work? Almost? What differences do you have? You may use code that implements the main idea of your project, but then you must have a project that explores modifications to the basic code, a substantially different dataset or for a different purpose than the original authors intended.\r\n\r\n***\r\n### **Analysis** \r\nNow that you have used this approach, what do you think are its main strengths and weaknesses.",
